1. Project Overview and Problem Definition:-

	A. Real-World Problem Addressed:-

	The project tackles the common real-world problem of cognitive overload and inefficiency in personal and professional life. Individuals frequently struggle to maintain a centralized and accessible list of commitments, leading to missed deadlines and increased stress.

	B. Problem Statement:-

	The goal was to design and implement a simple, persistent, and accessible command-line utility that allows users to quickly perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a list of tasks, thus improving personal productivity through better organization.

	C. Solution Description:-

	The solution is a minimal Python script that uses basic file input/output (I/O) to store task data in a local file (todo_list.txt). This ensures persistence without relying on complex databases or external libraries.

2. Approach and Design Methodology:-

	A. Design Approach: Top-Down Design (Modularization):-

	The project utilized the Top-Down Design methodology to ensure code clarity, modularity, and maintainability.

	The system was logically divided into three distinct functional layers:

	Level 1: The Controller (main()): Manages the application flow, presenting the menu and interpreting user input.

	Level 2: Core Logic (CRUD Functions): Implements the primary user actions (add_task, complete_task, etc.). These functions operate 		only on the in-memory list state.

	Level 3: Utility/Persistence Layer (load_tasks, save_tasks): Handles the low-level mechanics of reading from and writing to the 		todo_list.txt file, isolating file I/O errors from the main application logic (Separation of Concerns).

	B. Tooling and Requirements

	Language	Python (3.x)	Simplicity, readability, and speed of development for a utility task.

	Modules	os,  (Built-in only)	Ensures zero external dependency, making the program instantly runnable on any system with Python 					installed.

	Data Storage	Local Text File (todo_list.txt)	Provides simple persistence without needing a database server or complex data 				structures.

3. Implementation Details:-

	A. Data Structure and State Management:-

	The core state of the application is managed by a simple Python list (tasks). Each task is stored as a string containing the 	status marker ([ ] or [x]) and the description (e.g., "[ ] Buy milk"). This approach allows for easy manipulation using standard 	list methods (append, pop) and string manipulation (replace).

	B. Key Implementation Techniques:-

	Persistence Functions (load_tasks, save_tasks):-

	load_tasks() uses os.path.exists() and a try...except block for fault tolerance, preventing crashes if the data file is missing or 	corrupted.

	save_tasks() uses write mode ('w') and ensures a newline character (\n) is appended to each saved task to maintain correct file 	formatting.

	Update Logic (complete_task):-

	The function uses list indexing (index - 1) to target the specific task.

	It implements the critical update using old_task.replace("[ ]", "[x]", 1), ensuring only the task's initial status marker is 	changed.
	
	Input Validation:-

	Type Validation: try...except ValueError blocks are used in complete_task and delete_task to handle non-numeric input, upholding 	robustness.

	Range Validation: A check (0 <= task_index < len(tasks)) is performed to ensure the user-supplied index is a valid task number, 	preventing an IndexError.

4. Results and Analysis:-

	A. Functional Results (Meeting Objectives):-

	All core objectives were met:

	Persistence: Successfully verified via testing (Test Case 9) that data loads and saves across sessions.

	CRUD Operations: All four operations (Add, View, Complete, Delete) are functional and reliable.

	Status Tracking: The [ ] and [x] markers are correctly maintained and updated.

	UI: The numbered menu is clear and easy to navigate.

	B. Testing Summary:-

	The system proved robust across critical edge cases:-

	Persistence Check	PASS	Validated the fundamental requirement that the data layer (load_tasks/save_tasks) correctly 						handles file I/O.

	Persistence Check	PASS	Validated the fundamental requirement that the data layer (load_tasks/save_tasks) correctly 						handles file I/O.

	invalid Index/Input	PASS	Confirmed that try...except blocks and range checks prevent crashes, directing the user to input 					valid data.

	Already Complete	PASS	The dedicated check (if old_task.startswith("[x]")) provided specific feedback to the user, 						enhancing the application's usability.

	C. Conclusion and Future Refinement:-

	The Command-Line To-Do List Manager successfully solves the stated problem with a minimal, elegant implementation. The reliance on 	built-in modules achieves the project goals for simplicity and accessibility.

	Potential Future Refinements:

	Priority Flagging: Add the ability to label tasks with high/medium/low priority using a separate status marker.

	Date Tracking: Incorporate the datetime module to allow users to add due dates and sort the list by urgency.

	Search/Filter: Implement a simple search function to filter tasks by keywords or status ([ ] or [x]).
